# hello-class
Welcome everybody! Feel free to do whatever you would like to to this repository. Be free, let your heart be light

## Instructions
*(copied from the Lesson notebook)*
Navigate to the repository in your userspace on GitHub and get the URL for cloning. It should look like this: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/hello-class`. **It's important that you get your version of the repository.**

Once you have that URL copied, head back to JupyterHub, go to the shell, and do `cd ..` to get out of your repository folder.

Then, run `git clone` and your URL. `cd` into the shiny new `hello-class` repository and look around.

It's now your job to make some changes. Add a file, change around the files I've got there, edit my README, do whatever you want. **Note:** Remember to run `git add .` if you add any files.

Once you're done, do `git commit` and save your changes, then `git push` them back up to GitHub.
